below, a one-page introduction describing
how Allianz Life Pro+ works, and the rates and
assumptions used in your policy illustration.

POLICY DESCRIPTION
This section provides a high level overview of
your life insurance policy’s features and
benefits. It also defines certain terms used
throughout this illustration. For complete
information about Allianz Life Pro+, please

This is the numbers part of the illustration,
and reflects the inputs and assumptions you
chose to illustrate. Before you review your
ledgers, please read the Basic Concepts
below.

NUMERIC SUMMARY
This is a one-page summary of the illustration
information and contains important
disclosures for you to review. We ask both
you and your financial professional to sign this
page to confirm you fully understand the
features, benefits, and limitations of your
illustration.

The Overview and Policy Description comprise the Narrative Summary of this illustration.

Basic Concepts
As you review your illustration, please keep the following concepts in mind:
What is Life Insurance?

Many Possibilities

Life insurance is a contract between you and an insurance
company. The main purpose of life insurance is to provide a
financial benefit to your loved ones in the event of an early
death. Typical reasons for buying life insurance include paying
funeral expenses, providing mortgage assistance,
supplementing educational expenses for children and spouses,
replacing lost income, and helping to protect the value of an
estate after the insured passes on.

Interest rates and policy charges are only two of the many factors
that can affect your policy’s actual performance. Please be
aware that your actions can impact your policy as well. The
timing and amount of any premiums you pay, loans or
surrenders you take, and policy benefit changes you make will
have a large effect on your policy values.

Guaranteed vs. Nonguaranteed Values
The illustration ledgers show both guaranteed and
nonguaranteed values. The guaranteed values illustrate a
“worst case scenario,” and assume minimum interest rates and
maximum policy charges are applied in all policy years.
Nonguaranteed values are based on interest rates and policy
charges that are subject to change. Because of this, we cannot
promise that your actual policy values will match the
nonguaranteed values in this illustration.

Length of Coverage
If your policy’s cash value drops below a certain level, your policy
will lapse unless you pay additional premium or lower your policy
benefits. If your policy lapses, you will lose the death benefit,
you will no longer be able to take money from your policy, and
you may owe income taxes on the money you took out
(including any loan balance).
In this illustration, your length of coverage will vary based on the
assumptions used. Your projected lapse years for the
guaranteed and nonguaranteed scenarios are shown in the
Numeric Summary.

Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claimspaying ability of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North
America.

Allianz Life Pro+® Fixed Index Universal Life Insurance Policy Illustration

OVERVIEW

How Allianz Life Pro+ Works
Allianz Life Pro+ is a fixed index universal life insurance policy that provides a death benefit to your
beneficiary(ies) that is income tax-free. It also provides tax deferred growth potential.
Three Death Benefit Options

Taking Money Out

Option A is equal to the specified amount of your policy.

While the insured is still living, you can take money from your
policy in a number of ways.

Option B is equal to the specified amount of your policy plus the
accumulation value.
Option C is equal to the specified amount of your policy plus the
total premium you have paid into the policy.
Option A is the default death benefit option if you do not make a
selection on your application. Regardless of the death benefit
option you choose, any outstanding loan balance will reduce the
death benefit.

Lapse Protection
When you buy your policy, your policy will be guaranteed to
remain in force for 10 policy years so long as the total premiums
you have paid into the policy (less any surrenders and
outstanding loan balance) exceed the total minimum monthly
premiums due. Note that as long as the total premium paid
meets this policy protection test, you do not have to pay the
minimum monthly premium each month.

How Your Policy Value Can Grow
The values in your policy can earn interest. Any interest credited
to your policy accumulates tax-deferred, and is only taxable if you
take certain distributions from your policy.

Policy loans Subject to certain restrictions and costs, you may be
able to take a loan from your policy.
Partial surrenders You may also have the ability to withdraw
money from your policy. Partial surrenders must be at least $500
and may incur a charge of up to $50.
Full surrender You also have the option to surrender, or cancel,
your policy and receive the cash value. Surrender charges will
apply during the first 10 policy years.
Policy loans and withdrawals will reduce available cash values and
death benefits and may cause the policy to lapse, or affect
guarantees against lapse. Additional premium payments may be
required to keep the policy in force. In the event of a lapse,
outstanding policy loans in excess of unrecovered cost basis will be
subject to ordinary income tax. Tax laws are subject to change.
You should consult with a tax professional.

Policy Charges
We deduct charges from your policy to offset various expenses we
incur in connection with a life insurance policy including, but not
limited to, the expenses of underwriting, issuing and
administering the policy, agent compensation, and the mortality
risks we assume.

Allianz Life: Over 115 years old and still going strong.

Since 1896, we've had the strength and stability to fulfill our promises. Through bull markets and bear
markets, we've stayed true to our careful planning, disciplined investing, and risk management expertise.
That's why we're well positioned for what's ahead.

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Understanding Policy Value

Earning Interest

Your policy has four different values, each of which is used for its
own purposes.

When you buy your policy, you can choose to allocate your current
value among several allocations. You can put all your current value
in one allocation or divide it up among multiple allocations.

Accumulation Value
Accumulation value is equal to the greater of the current value or
the guaranteed accumulation value.

Current Value
Current value reflects the money you put into the policy (less
premium charges) plus the accumulation bonus and any fixed
and/or indexed interest earned, minus any money taken out (such
as surrenders and policy charges). Interest earned and policy
charges are based on current (nonguaranteed) rates that can
change throughout the life of your policy.

Guaranteed Accumulation Value
Guaranteed accumulation value is similar to the current value,
except it earns fixed interest only and incurs policy charges at
guaranteed rates. The 0.10% minimum fixed interest rate, and the
maximum policy charges are applied in all policy years.

Cash Value
Cash value is the amount you would get if you cancelled (“cashed
in”) your policy. It’s equal to your accumulation value minus the
full surrender charge and any outstanding loan balance.

Premium
Allianz Life Pro+ has different measures of premium, each of
which is used for its own purposes.
Planned premium. When you buy your policy, you specify your
planned premium, which is the amount of premium you plan to
pay each policy year. You can pay more or less than the planned
premium in any policy year. You can change the amount of your
planned premium once per policy year. The change will be
effective on the next monthly anniversary.
Base premium. During the first policy year, your base premium is
equal to your planned premium. In later years, it’s equal to the
lesser of your planned premium and the actual amount of
premium you paid during the previous policy year.
Minimum monthly premium. Minimum monthly premium is
used during the first 10 policy years to determine if your policy
passes the policy protection test, as described earlier in this
document.

Accumulation Bonus
The Accumulation Bonus is automatically included in your policy.
Under this rider, a guaranteed annual bonus of 0.6% will be
credited to the policy’s accumulation value starting in policy year
11. We will calculate and credit a bonus to your Accumulation
Value starting on the first monthly anniversary after the 10th
policy anniversary and every monthly anniversary thereafter. Any
bonus credits to your Accumulation Value will be allocated
according to your current Allocation Percentages. We will
continue to credit the Accumulation Bonus as long as the policy
remains in force.

MLIF-1066, Ver5.3.28.74 (Rev 02/16)

Current value tied to premium you pay each year up to the base
premium will be placed in the allocations according to your
allocation choices. Any current value tied to premium you pay in
excess of the base premium will be placed in an interim allocation
where it will earn fixed interest until the end of the policy year. At
that time, we will distribute the interim current value to your
allocations according to your choices.
You can change your allocation once a policy year, by sending a
request to us during the first 21 days of the policy year. You can
send a request to change your allocation at other times, but your
request won’t be processed until the beginning of the next policy
year.
Once the insured reaches age 120, we allocate 100% of the current
value to the fixed allocation.

The Fixed Allocation
With this allocation, we credit interest to the current value at a
specified interest rate. The interest rate can be reset at the
beginning of each policy year, although some policy years it may
not change. And no matter what, it will always be at least 0.10% per
policy year. Interest is credited to current value in the fixed
allocation 365 days a policy year.

Indexed Allocations
With these allocations, how much interest we credit to your current
value depends on the performance of an external index (or indexes)
and which interest crediting method you choose.
The available crediting method and index combinations are shown
below.

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Please note: Although external indexes may affect your policy
values, this policy does not participate in any stock or
investments, and you are not buying shares of any stock or
index.

Annual Point-to-Point Crediting with a Floor. For this method, we
start by setting an annual cap and an annual floor. They can be
reset every policy year, but the annual cap will never be less than
0.50% and the annual floor will never be less than 0.50%.

Crediting Methods

We determine the interest rate using the same calculations
described above for the blended index, and also apply the annual
floor in the final step. Your annual interest rate will always be
between the floor and the cap amount.

Allianz Life Pro+ gives you different options for determining how
external index performance will translate into the amount of
interest credited. For all crediting methods, we determine the
interest rate on the last day of each policy year.
Annual Point-to-Point Crediting. For each indexed allocation with
this method, we start by setting an annual cap, which is the
maximum possible interest rate for the policy year. The annual
cap can be reset every policy year, but it will never be less than
0.50%. Your annual interest rate will always be between 0.00% and
the cap amount.
For each single index option, we look at the change in the external
index for the policy year. If the index went up more than the cap
percentage, your interest rate will be equal to the cap for the
option. If the index went down, your interest rate will be 0.00%. If
the index change is somewhere between 0.00% and the cap, then
your interest rate is the same as the change of the index.
For the blended index option, we look at the change in each
external index for the policy year. We multiply each index change
by the corresponding index weight. We then add up the four
weighted index changes, and apply the cap and 0.00% minimum
to determine your interest rate.
Annual Point-to-Point Crediting ||. For this method, we start by
setting a participation rate and an annual floor. They can be reset
every policy year, but the participation rate will never be less than
5% and the annual floor will never be less than 0.50%.
We then look at the change in the external index for the policy
year and multiply the change by the participation rate. If the result
is more than the annual floor, your interest rate will be equal to the
result. Otherwise, your interest rate for that year will be equal to
the annual floor.

Monthly Sum Crediting. For each indexed allocation with this
method, we start by setting a monthly cap. The monthly cap can be
reset every policy year, but it will never be less than 0.50%.
For each single index option, we look at the external index change
every policy month. If it went up more than the cap percentage, we
record the cap as your change for the month. If the index went up
less than the cap percentage, or it went down, we record the index
change as your number for the month.
At the end of each policy year, we add up the change percentages
for the 12 months, both positive and negative. If the result is
positive, that result is the interest rate we credit for the policy year. If
the result is negative, your interest rate will be 0.00%.
Monthly Average Crediting. With this method, we start by setting a
participation rate. The participation rate can be reset every policy
year, but it will never be less than 5%.
We perform the following calculations for each external index in
the blended index: We look at the value for each external index at
the end of every policy month and determine an average for the 12
months. We calculate the change between the index value for the
beginning of the policy year and the average index value, and then
multiply the index change by the corresponding index weight.
After performing the above calculations for each index, we add up
the four weighted index changes, and then multiply by the
participation rate.
If the result is a positive number, that number is the interest rate for
the policy year. If the result is negative, your interest rate will be
0.00%.

Annual Point-to-Point Crediting |||. For this method, we start by
setting a participation rate. The participation rate can be reset
every policy year, but it will never be less than 5%.

Trigger Method Crediting. With this method, we start by setting a
trigger interest rate. The trigger interest rate can be reset every
policy year, but it will never be less than 0.50%.

We then look at the change in the external index for the policy
year and multiply the change by the participation rate. If the result
is more than 0.00%, your interest rate will be equal to the result.
Otherwise, your interest rate for that year will be 0.00%.

At the end of each policy year, we look at the change in the external
index for the policy year. If the index change was zero or more, your
interest rate will be equal to the trigger interest rate. If the index
went down, your interest rate will be 0.00%.

Crediting Method Insights
Annual Point-to-Point, Trigger Method

Monthly Sum

Monthly Average

These crediting methods use the index value
from only two points in time. Changes in the
index throughout the policy year do not
directly impact the indexed interest rate.

Steady monthly increases will generally add up
to a positive indexed interest rate. One or
more sharp monthly decreases can offset
positive monthly increases and result in a
0.00% indexed interest rate.

If the index value was usually higher than the
beginning index value, the indexed interest
rate will generally be positive. Sharp index
drops can weigh down the average index
value and result in a 0.00% indexed interest
rate.

Based on Historical performance, the following are average rates for
the time periods indicated. Keep in mind that different time periods
and different indices will produce higher or lower averages, and
that even if the average credited rate for a policy is as illustrated,
actual policy values could be different because of year to year
differences in actual credited rates. Your non-guaranteed illustrated
values are based on your allocation percentages. The rates
described below are based on the current caps, participation
rates or spreads shown in Your Chosen Allocations for all years
during the stated period. Keep in mind that past performance is
not a prediction of future results. Different time periods and
different indexes will produce higher or lower averages, and actual
credited rates will vary from year to year. Also, caps, participation

The maximum illustrated rate for the index allocation is calculated
using the annual point-to-point crediting method and the S&P 500
index, in accordance with illustration regulations. To determine this
limit, we calculate the average annualized rates for each 25-year
period in the last 65 calendar years assuming the current annual
cap was in effect every year.
The arithmetic average of these annualized rates is the maximum
illustrated rate for the index allocation; we also show the maximum

Loans and Surrenders
With Allianz Life Pro+, you can access your policy’s value while the
insured is still living in a number of ways.
If you take a policy loan or surrender from your policy, you
will reduce the death benefit and available policy values, and
you may cause the policy to lapse. In addition, you may be
required to pay taxes on the distributions.
Before you take a policy loan or surrender from your policy, please
ask a knowledgeable tax or legal advisor about your own situation.

Policy Loans
Policy loans reduce your cash value and death benefit dollar for
dollar. If you do not pay loan interest when it is due, your loan
balance will increase, and the interest will reduce your cash value
and death benefit dollar for dollar.

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Surrenders
You can also withdraw part of your cash value. Partial surrenders
must be at least $500, and may be subject to a partial surrender
charge of up to $50. Partial surrenders (and any partial surrender
charges) reduce your policy values and death benefit dollar for
dollar. The amount of current value allocated to each allocation
decreases by the same percentage as the overall value decreases.
If you take a partial surrender from an indexed allocation with a
positive interest rate, we will credit prorated interest to your current
value at the end of the policy year in which the surrender occurs.
(Because the fixed allocation credits interest every day, interest will
already be credited when the surrender is processed.)

When you take a policy loan, we link it to your current value in the
same percentages that your current value is allocated. You may
also choose to have your policy loan allocated differently than your
current value on any policy anniversary. You may change the type
of loan you have on any policy anniversary by reallocating your
policy loan. If you do so, the current value linked to the policy loan
will be reallocated in the same percentages. We must receive your
request to reallocate your policy loan during the first 21 days of the
policy year. You can send a request to change your policy loan
allocation at other times, but your request won’t be processed
until the beginning of the next policy year.
Once the insured reaches age 120, we allocate 100% of the
current value (including any loan balance) to the fixed allocation.
Loan interest is charged in advance and credited at the end of the
policy year, based on the allocation the loan is linked to.

Both types of loans charge a set rate each year. The net cost of a
fixed loan will always be negative during the first 10 policy years
and neutral thereafter. The net cost of an indexed loan could be
positive or negative, depending on the indexed interest rate at
the end of the year. Therefore, indexed loans are more risky
than fixed loans, and will increase the impact of poor index
performance on your policy.

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Policy Charges

Death Benefit

Your policy has three types of charges: premium charges, monthly
deductions and surrender charges.

Your beneficiaries can take the death benefit in a lump sum, income
tax-free payment, or as a stream of income payments. If your
beneficiaries choose an income stream payout option of at least 10
years, Allianz Life Pro+ will increase the death benefit by 10%.

Premium charges. We will deduct a premium charge of 5% as
premium is paid into the policy.
Monthly deductions. We will deduct a monthly deduction from
your current value and guaranteed accumulation value at the
beginning of each policy month. Monthly deductions include an
insurance cost charge, rider charges, a policy charge, and an
expense charge.

Please note: The part of the income payment representing the
death benefit is income tax-free; the remainder of the payment is
taxable to the beneficiary.

• The insurance cost charge is based on factors such as the
insured’s gender, age, specified amount, and risk class.

After your policy is issued, you may decide to make a change to your
policy. Changes typically fall under two categories: material
changes and reductions in benefits. Before you make either type of
policy change, we recommend that you request a new policy
illustration, and then review your policy with a knowledgeable tax or
legal advisor.

• Rider charges will vary depending on your selection of optional
riders.
• The policy charge is $7.50 per policy.
• The expense charge is a per $1,000 charge of your policy's
specified amount, and is based on factors such as the insured’s
gender, age, specified amount, and risk class.
Surrender charges. If you cancel your policy, you will receive the
cash value, which is equal to the accumulation value minus the full
surrender charge and any outstanding loan balance. Surrender
charges are based on factors such as the insured’s gender, age,
specified amount, and risk class, and will apply during the first 10
policy years. Also, if you take a partial surrender, it may be subject
to a partial surrender charge of up to $50.

Policy Lapse
If the cash value is less than the amount of a policy charge due,
and your policy does not pass the policy protection test as
described earlier in this document, your policy will enter a 60-day
grace period. If you do not send us premium sufficient to keep the
policy in force by the end of the grace period, your policy will lapse.
If your policy lapses, you will lose the death benefit, you will no
longer be able to take money from your policy, and you may
owe income taxes on the money you took out (including any
outstanding loan balance).
Under certain circumstances, we may allow a policy reinstatement
within three years of the policy lapse.

MLIF-1066, Ver5.3.28.74 (Rev 02/16)

Making Policy Changes

Material Changes
The following policy changes are considered material changes:
Death benefit increase If you increase your policy’s death benefit,
your minimum monthly premium will increase. In addition, if you
request the increase during the first five policy years, a new
surrender charge schedule will begin for the increase at that time.
Change in death benefit option After the first policy year, you may
change your death benefit option. The new death benefit option will
be effective on the next monthly anniversary. You cannot change to
Option C after issue, and you cannot change from Option C to
Option B.
Change of risk class If the insured’s rate class improves from
tobacco to nontobacco after you buy your policy (subject to
underwriting), minimum monthly premiums and insurance cost
charges will decrease.
Add a rider If you add a rider, your minimum monthly premium will
increase.
Keep in mind, if your minimum monthly premium increases, you
may need to pay additional premium to protect your policy from
lapse. In addition, if you make any of the above material changes,
a new seven-year premium limitation will begin at that time, and
you will have new premium limitations under Section 7702A of
the Internal Revenue Code.

Allianz Life Pro+® Fixed Index Universal Life Insurance Policy Illustration

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Reductions in benefits

Life Insurance Taxation

The following changes are considered reductions in benefit:

Interest: Any interest you earn will be “tax deferred,” meaning you
will not owe taxes unless you take a taxable distribution from your
policy.

• Death benefit decrease
• Remove a rider
If you request a reduction in benefit within the seven-year
premium limitation period, the 7-pay premium will be
recalculated to reflect the reduced benefit. The reduced 7-pay
premium will be applied as if the policy had originally been issued
at the reduced benefit level.
We will refund any premium that exceeds the life insurance
qualification limits under Section 7702A of the Internal Revenue
Code to prevent the policy from becoming a MEC.

Federal Taxes
Everyone’s tax situation is different; we suggest that you ask a
knowledgeable tax or legal advisor about your own tax situation.
We do not give legal or tax advice, but for your convenience, we
provide the following general information on federal taxes. (Be
aware that you could have state tax considerations as well.)
This policy is intended to comply with the definition of life
insurance in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code. When
you buy your policy, you must specify whether you want the
guideline premium test (GPT) or the cash value accumulation test
(CVAT) used to qualify your policy as life insurance. Once you
choose a test, you cannot change it.
The most common test used for Allianz Life Pro+ is GPT, which
specifies the maximum amount of premium you can pay into your
policy. The total premiums paid for the policy must not exceed the
guideline single premium or the cumulative guideline level annual
premiums, whichever is greater.
The guideline premiums for this policy are:
• Guideline Annual Premium: $100,657.54
• Guideline Single Premium: $490,866.25
If you plan to fund your policy with a single premium payment,
CVAT may be the test you choose. This test compares the
relationship between the cash value and death benefit, and
generally allows a larger single premium payment than the GPT.

Loans: Unless your policy is a MEC (which we describe later), loans
will not be subject to tax while your policy is in force. However, if
your policy lapses, you take a full surrender, or you transfer,
exchange, or assign your policy, outstanding policy loans in excess
of un-recovered cost basis will be subject to ordinary income tax.
Surrenders: Unless your policy is a MEC (which we describe later),
surrenders you take from your policy will be treated as if the cost
basis is distributed first. This means you will not be taxed on the
money you take until the entire cost basis has been distributed and
you begin to withdraw interest.

Modified Endowment Contracts
In order to receive favorable federal tax treatments on distributions
taken during the lifetime of the insured, the total premiums you pay
into the policy must satisfy the 7-pay premium limitation.
Otherwise, your policy could be considered a Modified Endowment
Contract (MEC). Making policy changes that are material changes or
reductions in benefits may also result in your policy becoming a
MEC.
If you take a distribution from a MEC, we must first distribute any
interest you have earned in your policy. Interest will be taxed as
ordinary income. In addition, with certain exceptions, there will be
an additional 10% federal tax assessed if a distribution is taken
before the owner turns age 59 ½.
If your policy becomes a MEC after the issue date, there will be a
“look back” on any distributions you took during the last two years.
Those distributions will be taxed as if your policy was a MEC when
the distributions were taken.
7-pay premium limitation. Your policy has a 7-pay premium
limitation during the first seven policy years. To satisfy this
requirement, the total premiums you have paid into the policy at
any time must not exceed the sum of the
7-pay annual premiums at that point in time. Your 7-pay annual
premium is $128,539.92.

We will refund any premium that exceeds the life insurance
qualification limits under Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue
Code. We make this determination based on our interpretation of
tax law.
The tax treatment of life insurance under federal tax law is subject
to change. You should review the tax status of your policy with a
knowledgeable tax or legal advisor each year.

Available Riders
The following optional benefits may be available to you at an
additional charge. Unless otherwise noted, riders must be
selected on your original policy application/worksheet.

Additional Term Rider
PR95359, Not Illustrated
The Additional Term Rider provides annual renewable term
insurance up to a specific multiplier of the face amount (based on
the multiplier available at the time of purchase), which combined
with the base death benefit cannot exceed $65 million. The
minimum term insurance amount that can be purchased is
$25,000.
The monthly rider charge for this benefit is a percentage of the rider
specified amount, and is based on the insured’s gender, age, rider
specified amount, and risk class.

Child Term Rider
PR95297, Not Illustrated
With this rider, you can purchase up to $10,000 term insurance
coverage for each of the insured's children. Coverage can begin for
any child between 15 days old and age 21, and can continue until
the policy anniversary after the child turns 25 or the policy
anniversary after the insured turns 65 (whichever is earlier).

POLICY DESCRIPTION

The monthly rider charge for this benefit is a percentage of the
specified amount, and is based on the insured’s gender, age,
specified amount, and risk class.

Enhanced Cash Value Rider
PR95362, Not Illustrated
This rider guarantees a minimum cash value during the first nine
policy years, equal to a percentage of the total premium paid. Your
policy must pass the policy protection test to be eligible for this
benefit. This rider will terminate if you assign or transfer ownership
of your policy.
The monthly rider charge for this benefit is a percentage of the
specified amount, and is based on the insured’s gender, age, and
risk class.

Premium Deposit Fund (PDF) Rider
PR95349, Not Illustrated
With this rider, you can fund your life insurance policy with a single
deposit to the PDF. At the beginning of the first policy year, we
withdraw your planned premium amount from the PDF to pay into
your policy. At the beginning of subsequent policy years, we
withdraw discounted amounts from the PDF to pay your annual
planned premiums. The discount rate will be declared on an annual
basis and will never be less than 0.25%.

After coverage has been in effect for 10 policy years, the policy
anniversary after a child turns 25, or the policy anniversary after the
insured turns 65 (whichever is earlier), coverage can be converted
to an approved Allianz permanent insurance policy without medical
underwriting.

When you deposit money into the PDF, you must pay enough to
fund at least three transfers, and there is a 10 transfer maximum.
After the last transfer, if there is value remaining in the PDF, we will
pay you the excess. If the amount credited to the policy is less than
the amount required to keep your policy in force, you may need to
pay additional premium to keep your policy in force.

You can add this rider to your policy at issue, or on the policy
anniversary following the birth or adoption of the insured’s first
child. The monthly rider charge for this benefit is a percentage of
the rider specified amount.

We will pay you the remaining value in the PDF if the rider
terminates. Conditions for termination are described in the PDF
rider. There is no charge for this rider.

Other Insured Term Rider
PR95296, Not Illustrated
This rider provides annual renewable term insurance for up to four
of the insured’s family members, with a combined death benefit up
to four times the base specified amount (or $1 million, whichever is
smaller). Coverage can continue until the policy anniversary after
the family member turns 100. The family members will be subject
to underwriting and must be approved by Allianz. The minimum
death benefit is $25,000 for standard risk classes and $100,000 for
preferred risk classes.
You can add this rider to your policy at issue, or on any policy
anniversary until the insured turns 100. This rider will terminate on
the policy anniversary after the insured turns 100.
The monthly rider charge for each other insured’s coverage is a
percentage of the other insured’s rider specified amount, and is
based on the other insured’s gender, age, rider specified amount,
and risk class.

Inflation Protection Rider
PR95292, Not Illustrated
After you exercise the Inflation Protection Rider, we will credit
earned inflation credits to the current value and the guaranteed
accumulation value at the end of each policy year for 20 policy
years. Credits will be based on changes in the CPI-U index. Once
credited, subsequent annual credits will never decrease. This rider
may be exercised on or after your first policy anniversary. The rider
charge begins when you exercise the rider and stops after 20 policy
years.

Loan Protection Rider
PR95298, Illustrated
The Loan Protection Rider helps prevent policy lapse due to policy
loans. If your outstanding loan balance equals or exceeds 90% of the
accumulation value and you meet the benefit eligibility conditions,
you may exercise the loan protection benefit.

Enhanced Liquidity Rider
PR95294, Not Illustrated
With this rider, you can waive either 100% or 50% of the full
surrender charges on your policy.
MLIF-1066, Ver5.3.28.74 (Rev 02/16)

Page 12 of 29

Allianz Life Pro+® Fixed Index Universal Life Insurance Policy Illustration

POLICY DESCRIPTION

This rider is automatically added to your policy unless you opt out
on the Numeric Summary page later in this document. There is no
charge for this rider until it is exercised. Once exercised, there is a
one-time charge, which is a percentage of the accumulation value.
If you exercise the Loan Protection Rider, any rider attached to the
policy will automatically terminate, except the Accumulation Bonus
Rider.
Please note: This policy may be purchased with the intent to
accumulate cash value on a tax-deferred basis, then take periodic
loans until the loan balance is just below the cash value, and then
rely on the Loan Protection Rider to keep the policy in force until the
death of the insured. Anyone considering this strategy should be
aware that neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the courts have
ruled on this strategy, and it may be challenged on the grounds that
the policy has effectively lapsed or been exchanged. If so, loans may
be treated as taxable distributions when the rider is exercised. In
that event, if policy loans were not already taxed when they were
taken, a significant tax liability could arise.

General rider information
Rider termination

Rider charges and taxes

Rider availability

If you transfer, exchange, or assign
ownership of your policy, make a policy
change, take a partial surrender, or if your
policy becomes a MEC, certain rider
benefits may terminate. Please read your
policy riders carefully before making a
change that could affect your rider benefits.

In a limited number of situations, the
amount deducted from your policy to pay
monthly rider charges may be taxable
(including a 10% federal additional tax if your
policy is a MEC). You should consult a tax
advisor prior to choosing a rider with a rider
charge.

You may not be able to choose every rider
described above. The riders must be
selected on your original policy
application/worksheet except for the Child
Term Rider and Other Insured Term Rider.
The specific riders issued with your policy will
be shown on your policy schedule.

POLICY DESCRIPTION

Definitions
Age
The insured's age at the end of the policy year.

Distributions
The total policy loans and partial surrenders you take. Distributions
are assumed to be taken at the beginning of the policy year.

Loan Charges
The interest charges for the loans you take. Loan charges are
taken at the beginning of the policy year and based on your
chosen loan allocations.

Loan Credits
The amount of fixed and/or indexed interest credited to the
portion of current value that is linked to a loan.

Net Distributions
Loan repayments less the total policy loans and partial surrenders
you take.

Policy Charges
The sum of all premium charges, policy fees, per unit charges, cost
of insurance charges, asset based charges, and rider charges.
Note: Loan charges are not considered policy charges.

Policy Credits
For the current and alternate scenarios: the fixed and/or indexed
interest credited to the current value. For the guaranteed
scenario: the interest credited to the guaranteed accumulation
value.

Premium Outlay
Premium paid. Premiums are assumed to be paid at the beginning
of the year (or of each modal period if non-annual), and are

amount under Premium Outlay in any year reflects premium
refunded in order to preserve the favorable tax treatment of the
policy as life insurance under federal tax law.

Sound Ratings
The ratings Allianz receives from independent rating
organizations confirm our financial strength. These independent
agency ratings are based on an analysis of financial results and an
evaluation of management objectives and strategies. The ratings

Illustration Ledgers

Sequence of Interest Rates, Current Scenario
Understanding how variations in credited rates can affect your policy is important as it can impact the death benefit, cash value
accumulation potential, how much of the cash value can be accessed from the policy, and how long the policy may remain in force.
Life insurance illustrations are commonly calculated assuming the policy will receive a level credited interest rate over the life of the policy
– but that’s not realistic. The external indexes on which the credited rates are based are volatile. That’s why it’s not possible to predict the
credited rates in any given year, and credited rates may be dramatically different from one year to the next based on a number of factors,
including market conditions. The timing of those credited rate variations can have a significant impact on your policy, particularly when
taking policy loans. Higher credited rates could mean that you would have more cash value to access through loans. Lower credited rates
could mean that there would be less cash value to access – so your loan amounts would need to be adjusted to help ensure the policy
does not lapse.
Here, we show a level interest rate of 7.09% for the index allocation, over all years of the policy and the a possible effect of a particular
sequence of varying credited rates, assuming current charges are applied in all policy years. This sequence of credited rates assumes the
following annual credits for the first four years for the index allocation, then repeating for the life of the policy: 0%, 9.56%, 9.56% and 9.56%.
The compound annual growth rate for any four-year period in this sequence is equal to the 7.09%. The portion allocated to the fixed
interest allocation uses the current fixed interest rate.

After you purchase an FIUL policy, it is critical that you review it annually to react to changing needs or market conditions. You may also
request an in-force illustration at any time during the life of your policy, which will show up-to-date policy values and will illustrate how
the policy may react going forward. Reviewing an in-force illustration, especially when you are taking policy loans, may uncover
adjustments that need to be made to keep the policy in line with your goals and objectives.

This illustration is not an offer, contract, or promise of future policy performance. Actual policy values may be more or less favorable than the nonguaranteed values
shown. Coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy. The assumptions on which this illustration is based are subject to change on an annual basis. This

At the current interest rates and current charges, and the premium and policy benefits specified in this illustration, this policy will mature
in year 89. If the amount of indexed interest earned on the loan is less than the assumed rate illustrated, the policy may lapse before the
time illustrated unless you pay additional premium or lower your policy benefits.

Policy loans and surrenders will reduce available cash values and death benefits, and may cause the policy to lapse, or affect guarantees
against lapse. Additional premium payments may be required to keep the policy in force. In the event of a lapse, outstanding policy loans
in excess of unrecovered cost basis will be subject to ordinary income tax. Tax laws are subject to change and you should consult your tax
professional.

This illustration is not an offer, contract, or promise of future policy performance. Actual policy values may be more or less favorable than the nonguaranteed values
shown. Coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy. The assumptions on which this illustration is based are subject to change on an annual basis. This
